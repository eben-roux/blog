<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-the-big-idea" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What&#39;s the big idea?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Domain-Driven Design is all about being explicit about how your object model functions.  To this end you need to reason in terms of <em><strong>hard edges</strong></em> around the various bits.  Defining those bits can be tricky but I hope that with the help of this guide things may be somewhat simpler or, at least, get you moving in a sensible direction.</p><p>I will be focusing on practical examples and scenarios that you may run into in your day-to-day modelling and the techniques you may wish to consider in order to implement a pragmatic solution.  I will be covering some of the basic concepts of Domain-Driven Design but there is ample literature on the matter so I&#39;ll be focusing on where the rubber meets the road. Feel free to skip over the concepts if you are comfortable in your understanding thereof.</p><p>We need to correctly divide up our domain in order to find the correct structure. This will require constant refactoring as we gain a better understanding of the domain. We need to constantly <em>analyse</em> our model to break down concepts into simpler building blocks and then <em>synthesize</em> them into more meaningful structures. This is something that is an iterative and ongoing exercise.</p><p>Remember that at the end of the day we are after a fluid and expressive domain model that will enable us to incorporate changes quicker and focus on the complexity within the domain. Always keep the end user in mind as this is going to be someone who may very well spend their entire working day using a system that you built. There is a great deal of satisfaction to be gained from providing a useful and usable system to one&#39;s users.</p><h2 id="target-audience" tabindex="-1">Target Audience <a class="header-anchor" href="#target-audience" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Target Audience&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This guidance is aimed at those software developers who would like additional resources to aid them in their modelling efforts as well as anyone interested in, or using, Domain-Driven Design. However, please keep in mind that this is my <em>current</em> opinion on how to tackle the identified issues. You should not substitute it for your own and you do not need to believe everything I say. You may have more experience dealing with a particular problem and, as such, your solution may very well be a better fit. Please do let me know if you have any ideas on improving the guidance. If we get stuck on a particular way of thinking, we&#39;ll be just that: stuck.</p><p>I will be covering some of the Domain-Driven Design concepts very briefly so if you are already familiar with those then feel free to skip over the relevant sections.</p><h2 id="about-the-author" tabindex="-1">About The Author <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-the-author" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About The Author&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Eben Roux has over 20 years of experience in the professional arena as a developer, consultant, and architect within many industries and has provided strategies and solutions that have contributed to the successful implementation of various systems. He believes firmly in the development of quality software that empowers users to get their job done.</p><p>His current focus is on domain-driven design implemented within an event-driven architecture based on message-oriented middleware.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;d like to thank my wife Amanda and my two wonderful boys Reynard and Reynier for their love and support in allowing me the time and patience to write this guide in aid of the developer community if only in a small way&quot;</p></blockquote><h1 id="concepts" tabindex="-1">Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Concepts&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="why-is-domain-driven-design-so-hard" tabindex="-1">Why is Domain-Driven Design so hard? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-domain-driven-design-so-hard" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why is Domain-Driven Design so hard?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>At first Domain-Driven Design may seem like a daunting experience and you may be wondering about the following:</p><ul><li>Where do I start?</li><li>Is Domain-Driven Design a right fit for my system?</li><li>Would a simple CRUD solution not be simpler?</li><li>Why is it so difficult to identify the concepts?</li></ul><p>These are all valid questions and can be widened to include most aspects of design, not just in the computer realm.</p><p>An aspect that most people do not consider when it comes to programming in general is that there is quite a bit of creativity involved and creativity is something that is all but impossible to learn. Creativity appears to come to the fore when we are faced with an indeterminate number of possibilities. This leads to one design not necessarily being better or worse than the next but rather just different.</p><p>There are different styles of music and each person has a general type of music they prefer. Some prefer many different styles and within a particular genre of music there are also certain musicians or bands that one may prefer over others. Does this mean one genre is better or worse than the next? Most certainly not.</p><p>Is it possible to learn how to be a great musician? One can learn all the basics of music and all the notes, scales, and chords. There is no variance when it comes to this <em>scientific</em> or <em>fixed</em> part of the music creation process. However, someone may be an excellent singer, pianist, or guitarist but without something original to rise above the rest you can only reproduce existing music.</p><p>There are an infinite number of combinations of notes to produce music as there are an infinite number of combinations of letters and words to create stories as there are an infinite number of combinations of paint and colour to produce artwork.</p><p>This is also true for any computer system design. There are certain structures (conditionals, loops, classes, etc.) that exist in any computer language and most programmers can pick up those and be proficient in a matter of months. However, there are an infinite number of ways in which we can put these structures together to design a solution. This is the <em>&quot;difficult&quot;</em> part.</p><p>This is where design patterns and perhaps some practical guidance such as this book can assist by making some concepts a bit more concrete and once we understand these concepts we can reason about a solution in a simpler way.</p><p>Object orientation is only one style of programming and if someone is not comfortable with this form of design then it certainly is possible to provide a solution using a different mechanism. Object orientation brings its own kind of magic to software solutions and I&#39;m sure many proponents of other approaches will say the same in respect of their approach. Use what you need and what you are comfortable with. Objects have not failed me yet and are flexible enough to provide solutions for any level of complexity.</p><p>It is not that Domain-Driven Design is difficult in-and-of itself but rather that design in general is tricky and it involves a lot of trial-and-error at the best of times. Keep refactoring and try different approaches until you hit something the <em>feels</em> right and that expresses the concepts in a fluid way.</p><h2 id="cohesion-and-coupling" tabindex="-1">Cohesion and Coupling <a class="header-anchor" href="#cohesion-and-coupling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cohesion and Coupling&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We have all heard that we need <em><strong>low coupling</strong></em> and <em><strong>high cohesion</strong></em> when it comes to software design in general.  Although we know what this means it can get rather tricky to identify when we are going off-track.</p><h3 id="cohesion" tabindex="-1">Cohesion <a class="header-anchor" href="#cohesion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cohesion&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Cohesion relates quite nicely to Robert C. Martin&#39;s <em>Single Responsibility Principle</em> that forms part of his SOLID principles. We should only place functionality together, typically in a class, when it all belongs together. No definitive list or set of rules will be able to identify all the moving parts that do belong together but if you feel that some parts can be split out without affecting how the class behaves then it may be a candidate for a different class. If you find that you need to re-use a bit of functionality contained in another class, then perhaps that bit of functionality is a candidate to be extracted.</p><h3 id="coupling" tabindex="-1">Coupling <a class="header-anchor" href="#coupling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Coupling&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Again, Robert C. Martin&#39;s <em>Dependency Inversion Principle</em> comes into play here. If we can rely on an interface contract as opposed to an actual implementation, then things start going better already. However, this does not mean that all classes have to be an implementation of an interface. Many domain classes require only state based interactions and, as such, an interface would not add any value. An interface is most useful when abstracting behaviour such as one would require in repositories or services.</p><p>Another coupling scenario is where relationships are represented in an object model. When it comes to traditional database Entity-Relationship modelling the fact that there are relationships between database entities tends to create a situation where it is too easy to follow the relations as far as they go; and sometimes they could go in circles. This is another area discussed in the guide where we need to create a hard edge around our aggregates.</p><h4 id="behavioural-coupling" tabindex="-1">Behavioural Coupling <a class="header-anchor" href="#behavioural-coupling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Behavioural Coupling&quot;">​</a></h4><p>When one component has to know how another component functions there exists a high degree of behavioural coupling.  This should be avoided where possible.  It is certainly in order to issue a command to another component and in such scenarios the behavioural coupling cannot be avoided.  However, notifications should only be concerned with the behaviour and data related directly to the component doing the notifying.  For instance, in a message-based solution we may have an endpoint that can send e-mails.  Sending a command to that endpoint requires us to, at the very least, know that the endpoint can actually accept and, ultimately, process the command we are sending.  Once the e-mail sender endpoint has completed its processing it should publish an event to notify any endpoint that subscribes to the event.  This subscription mechanism should be dealt with by an infrastructure component so that the component doing the notifying need not be concerned with any of the subscribers.  In this way we have removed <strong>all</strong> behavioural coupling between the components as the publisher has absolutely no interest in what a subscriber will do with its copy of the event.</p><h4 id="temporal-coupling" tabindex="-1">Temporal Coupling <a class="header-anchor" href="#temporal-coupling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Temporal Coupling&quot;">​</a></h4><p>When I pick up my phone and I place a call and no one answers the call I simply have to remember to call again. This is high temporal coupling since I have to rely on the person on the other end to be available to answer my call at a specific time. On the other hand, when I send someone an e-mail I feel quite comfortable that they will receive it in due course and respond if required. This is low temporal coupling since the e-mail can be sent irrespective of whether the recipient is available or not.</p><h2 id="business-terminology" tabindex="-1">Business Terminology <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-terminology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Business Terminology&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It may be worthwhile mentioning that there is a difference between the business terminology and how it maps to the strategic patterns in Domain-Driven Design. There isn&#39;t necessarily always a one-to-one mapping between these concepts and we are going to have scenarios where the technical approach has to remain in the technical solution space; the business folks do not <em>have</em> to know about these.</p><h3 id="domain" tabindex="-1">Domain <a class="header-anchor" href="#domain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Domain&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The domain is the total area of focus for our model.  Irrespective of the size of the domain you are in all likelihood going to run into a situation where different <em>parts</em> of your domain model will belong together. As with most things we will divide and conquer.</p><p>Although the following divisions in the domain are given specific names based on how you view them it is largely academic. We shouldn&#39;t need to split hairs over this and if you start off grouping the domain into logical units and calling each a <em>subdomain</em> then that is absolutely fine for a start.</p><h4 id="core-domain" tabindex="-1">Core Domain <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-domain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Domain&quot;">​</a></h4><p>This is the <em><strong>main</strong></em> part of your domain and carries the most weight. In terms of stock market parlance this falls right in the headline earnings space. It is the <em>raison d&#39;être</em> of your domain. This part <em>has</em> to work and has to work well and is that part of your system that everything revolves around. If you have a hard time nailing this down it means that you have a rather large core domain. It is what it is.</p><h4 id="generic-subdomain" tabindex="-1">Generic Subdomain <a class="header-anchor" href="#generic-subdomain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Generic Subdomain&quot;">​</a></h4><p>These aid in performing certain tasks in a generic way and the implementation details are not that important to our core domain. Financial accounting and calculation engines could be bought off-the-self and be used to perform these functions.</p><h4 id="supporting-subdomain" tabindex="-1">Supporting Subdomain <a class="header-anchor" href="#supporting-subdomain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Supporting Subdomain&quot;">​</a></h4><p>I think there is often confusion between generic and supporting subdomains. A supporting subdomain isn&#39;t something that is generic enough that you would probably <em>find</em> anything off-the-shelf available. It would be quite specific to your business requirements but still does not fall into the core of the business.</p><h2 id="technical-terminology" tabindex="-1">Technical Terminology <a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-terminology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technical Terminology&quot;">​</a></h2><h2 id="bounded-contexts" tabindex="-1">Bounded Contexts <a class="header-anchor" href="#bounded-contexts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bounded Contexts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When you consider your business domain as a whole it may be somewhat overwhelming. Not only that, but it may be quite difficult to reason about the various parts given that the behaviour of various classes may seem to change depending on how you interact with them.</p><p>It is for this reason that Domain-Driven Design has the concept of a <em>Bounded Context</em> where you can group together functionality based on the area they are related to. Typically, you would need a Domain Expert to identify these since we, as developers, hardly ever have in-depth knowledge of any particular domain. As your understanding and knowledge of a particular domain grows you will find that you can refine your design.</p><p>Having a Bounded Context at a granularity that is too fine or focused can also lead to problems. You should most definitely not have a single Aggregate Root represent an entire Bounded Context.</p><p>Sometimes you may run into a situation where the exact same concept appears in more than one Bounded Context. In most cases this indicates that your Bounded Context is too finely divided. However, keep in mind that it is entirely possible that you need to use the same concept across Bounded Contexts. If this happens you either need to use another Bounded Context to represent that concept or you may need to use a Shared Kernel. It is also entirely possible that you may need to represent an Aggregate Root from an upstream Bounded Context in your downstream Bounded Context. In such as case you will represent it as a Value Object.</p><h3 id="stadium-example" tabindex="-1">Stadium example <a class="header-anchor" href="#stadium-example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stadium example&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To make the concept of a Bounded Context more clear we could take seats in a stadium as an example.  A stadium contains seats but the same seat represents different things to different people.</p><h4 id="financial-management" tabindex="-1">Financial Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#financial-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Financial Management&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In most scenarios one would have to keep an asset register which is typically owned by the financial folks since they are the <em><strong>system of record</strong></em> for any assets.   The finance department would be interested in <em><strong>data</strong></em> for an <code>Asset</code> such as:</p><ul><li>asset number</li><li>asset type</li><li>date of purchase</li><li>cost</li><li>method of depreciation</li><li>date commissioned</li><li>date decommissioned</li></ul><p>They would also be interested in the following <em><strong>behaviour</strong></em>:</p><ul><li>Commission()</li><li>Depreciate()</li><li>Decommission()</li></ul><h4 id="maintenance-management" tabindex="-1">Maintenance Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#maintenance-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Maintenance Management&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The maintenance department would be interested in <em><strong>data</strong></em> for a <code>MaintenanceItem</code> such as:</p><ul><li>next maintenance date</li><li>maintenance schedules</li></ul><p>The <em><strong>behaviour</strong></em> for them would be along the lines of:</p><ul><li>ScheduleMaintenance()</li><li>RegisterMaintenanceSchedule()</li></ul><h4 id="event-management" tabindex="-1">Event Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Management&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The event booking folks would be have <em><strong>data</strong></em> for a <code>BookableItem</code> like this:</p><ul><li>event name</li><li>event date</li><li>seat number(s)</li></ul><p>And the relevant <em><strong>behaviour</strong></em> would include:</p><ul><li>RegisterEvent()</li><li>SellTicket()</li></ul><h4 id="putting-it-all-together" tabindex="-1">Putting it all together <a class="header-anchor" href="#putting-it-all-together" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Putting it all together&quot;">​</a></h4><p>As we can see, even though a particular seat is a single physical thing in the real world it can mean very different things to different people. This is where a <em>Bounded Context</em> comes in handy. You may even find that a similar concept is called something else in each context. You may find that an <code>Employee</code> in the <em>HR</em> Bounded Context is called a <code>User</code> in the <em>Identity &amp; Access Control</em> Bounded Context, or an <code>Author</code> in the <em>Collaboration</em> Bounded Context.</p><p>As behaviour is invoked on various objects within each Bounded Context the other Bounded Contexts may need to be informed. To accomplish this one would need some communication mechanism based on an <em>Event Driven Architecture</em>. That is, of course, where a service bus, such as Shuttle.Esb, would come in handy.</p><p>The <em>Financial Management</em> Bounded Context could publish an <code>AssetRegisteredEvent</code> and the other Bounded Contexts would subscribe to that event and then determine if they need to register the asset number as an item they are interested in.</p><p>When the <em>Maintenance Management</em> Bounded Context removes a seat for maintenance it would publish an \linebreak<code>ItemRemovedForMaintenanceEvent</code> that the <em>Booking Management</em> Bounded Context would subscribe to in order to exclude the seat as a bookable item for any events until the item is made available again. Any <code>EventBooking</code> that has this seat allocated to it may need to kick off some business process to inform the customer about the change and then go about rectifying the situation.</p><h3 id="canonical-models" tabindex="-1">Canonical Models <a class="header-anchor" href="#canonical-models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Canonical Models&quot;">​</a></h3><p>All this is quite different and in sharp contrast to what many enterprise-level architects refer to as a canonical data model. For our scenario a canonical model would need to include all the data from the various Bounded Contexts. This is quite cumbersome and really does not add any real value. Canonical Models tend to be so all-inclusive that just about everything ends up being optional data and each system interacting with the data would need various validation approaches to ensure that the data is correct.</p><p>From a Domain-Driven Design perspective we would want those rules, or <em>invariants</em>, as part of our domain code.</p><h3 id="shared-kernel" tabindex="-1">Shared Kernel <a class="header-anchor" href="#shared-kernel" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shared Kernel&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You may find some concepts in your domain that truly do cross over between Bounded Contexts. These will usually take the form of Value Objects and other infrastructure type classes. You can package these separately and safely share the assembly among your Bounded Contexts.</p><h2 id="ubiquitous-language" tabindex="-1">Ubiquitous Language <a class="header-anchor" href="#ubiquitous-language" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ubiquitous Language&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Ubiquitous Language represents an agreed upon set of terms that are specific to a Bounded Context and keeps everyone concerned with the development of the Bounded Context on the same page but it may be just as tricky to define what is regarded as belonging in the Ubiquitous Language.</p><p>What I have come across is that we may distill certain concepts into more generic artifacts within the domain model that a Domain Expert may not necessarily be aware of and that there would be no point in even discussing these with the Domain Expert as it may muddy the waters. This is the same reason we should not refer to concepts in terms of database structures or use other technical concepts and terms. We would also exclude all infrastructure components such as <code>SqlConnection</code> and the like.</p><p>For instance, if a Domain Expert <em>always</em> only refers to a <strong>Bank Account</strong> and the client&#39;s <strong>Investment Account</strong> we could quite possibly come up with some type of common <strong>Account</strong> structure that accommodates both scenarios. You may be thinking that we could just use inheritance and stick with the original terms but we will be introducing more into our domain model than is required since we would need to implement the associated <code>Repository</code> classes also. In the given scenario of only two options it may not seem like a big deal but when we run into tens or hundreds then it becomes almost certain that we need a common implementation.</p><p>There may be times when it may be appropriate to discuss the new concept as it may be a business concept that may have been missed, but if you find that it is more of a technical solution to create a more expressive domain then you may want to exclude it from the Ubiquitous Language.</p><p>As developers one of our main functions is to identify patterns and distill those into the required <em><strong>types</strong></em>. We may be working on an insurance claim system and our Domain Expert may refer to many different claim <em>types</em> and mention that each has a set of rules and behaviour that appear specific to that claim type. Whenever we approach this we need to find the lowest common denominator and work from there in order to find the reusable parts. We most certainly do not want to start by creating an Aggregate Root for each available claim that can be registered.</p><h2 id="reachability-reusability" tabindex="-1">Reachability / Reusability <a class="header-anchor" href="#reachability-reusability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reachability / Reusability&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When we have a bit of code we always need some way to invoke that functionality. We need some way of reaching that code. Here I&#39;m not referring to a user invoking the functionality but rather the <em>code</em> sitting behind <em>that</em> invocation is what I&#39;m referring to.</p><p>We should be aiming for reusability here in an <em>Open/Closed Principle</em> sense. Referencing functionality through an assembly or some proxy (over-the-wire) is the go-to method.</p><p>The more re-usable the option the more design is involved in order to find the balance between re-usability and business functionality.</p><h3 id="copy-paste" tabindex="-1">Copy &amp; Paste <a class="header-anchor" href="#copy-paste" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Copy &amp; Paste&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is the most simplistic way to invoke functionality that we require. It is also the worst way one could go about doing so. We have a couple of lines of code, or a method, and we simply copy what we need and paste it in its new home. The issues with this are well documented and it leads to a maintenance nightmare.</p><h3 id="referencing-source-code" tabindex="-1">Referencing Source Code <a class="header-anchor" href="#referencing-source-code" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Referencing Source Code&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We could make use of an existing source code file and invoke a method in that file. This is not ideal but a step in the right direction.</p><h3 id="referencing-an-assembly" tabindex="-1">Referencing an Assembly <a class="header-anchor" href="#referencing-an-assembly" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Referencing an Assembly&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once we have a cohesive grouping in our functionality we could package that as an assembly and reference the assembly in any subsequent usage scenarios. We can then invoke the relevant functionality by making use of the code exposed by the assembly. Package managers such as <em>Nuget</em> are quite useful in such scenarios.</p><h3 id="over-the-wire" tabindex="-1">Over The Wire <a class="header-anchor" href="#over-the-wire" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Over The Wire&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Another way to get to functionality is by invoking it <em>over-the-wire</em>. We can connect to the relevant endpoint using an exposed protocol and then make the required call. This could be anything from a Restful API, a Web Service, RPC, or even using a queue.</p><h1 id="practical-guidance" tabindex="-1">Practical Guidance <a class="header-anchor" href="#practical-guidance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practical Guidance&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="bounded-context-granularity" tabindex="-1">Bounded Context Granularity <a class="header-anchor" href="#bounded-context-granularity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bounded Context Granularity&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Finding the correct granularity for a Bounded Context is quite important. If you find yourself considering making each Aggregate Root a Bounded Context in and of itself then stop. This is much too fine grained and will end up being <em>very</em> confusing. If you have started down this path you are going to have to group your Aggregate Roots into something that is more sensible.</p><h2 id="repositories" tabindex="-1">Repositories <a class="header-anchor" href="#repositories" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Repositories&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="repository-a-seems-to-require-repository-b" tabindex="-1">Repository A seems to require Repository B <a class="header-anchor" href="#repository-a-seems-to-require-repository-b" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Repository A seems to require Repository B&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This may be a case of Entity B being part of an Aggregate Root A. Creating an aggregate that contains the entity from Repository B may be the answer. Sometimes things are not as clear-cut as that, though.</p><p>Since object orientation facilitates reuse it is quite possible that we have some generic entity that we reuse between aggregates. In the original work by Eric Evans[1] on one of the very first pages we have an image that contains the following relationships:</p><p><img src="/images/hard-edges/building-blocks.jpg" alt="Building Blocks"></p><h3 id="minimal-interface" tabindex="-1">Minimal interface <a class="header-anchor" href="#minimal-interface" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Minimal interface&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Although the idea behind a repository is that it represents an in-memory collection we should avoid returning list of Aggregate Roots.

To understand why I say this we need to take a look at why one class depends on another in the first place. There are two reasons.</p><h4 id="ownership" tabindex="-1">Ownership <a class="header-anchor" href="#ownership" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ownership&quot;">​</a></h4><p>An example of an <em>ownership</em> relationship is a <code>Customer</code> having a related collection of <code>Order</code> objects. Ownership is only ever between Aggregate Roots. One Aggregate Root may never <em>contain</em> or hold a reference to another Aggregate Root. There is nothing wrong in passing one Aggregate Root to another as a transient reference in order for the other Aggregate Root to perform some action. In order to break any direct reference there is typically only an <code>Id</code> to the related Aggregate Root or you could make use of a Value Object to represent the relationship.</p><p>In the case of an <code>Order</code> one would usually store only the <code>CustomerId</code>. However, one of the reasons an <code>Order</code> can stand alone is that it is an Aggregate Root and, as such, should one ever delete the associated customer the order would <em>not</em> necessarily be deleted. The order has a lifetime of its own. To that end one could create an order without a <em>real</em> customer. Think of this in terms of a physical order book. You pick up a pen and write the details into the book along with the items ordered. If you recognize your customer or they give you their <em>customer number</em> you could add that as a reference. A new customer that is only going to buy something from you once does not get a customer number and you only record the bare minimum. This is along the same lines as having an account with a clothing store. Some people buy cash and others by on account or use a loyalty card. All the sales can be processed whether or not it is a known customer or a cash sale.</p><p>Therefore, we could <em>denormalize</em> the customer data into a Value Object that contains an <em>optional</em> <code>CustomerId</code>. This could be stored as a nullable foreign key in our data store.</p><h4 id="containment" tabindex="-1">Containment <a class="header-anchor" href="#containment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Containment&quot;">​</a></h4><p>These Entities or Value Objects typically have no reason to exist on their own and you&#39;ll find that they also usually represent an <em>associative entity</em> in terms of Entity Relationship Modeling:</p><p><img src="/images/hard-edges/associative-entity.jpg" alt="Associative Entity"></p><p>In such a case we&#39;ll pick one of the sides as the primary owner. An <code>OrderItem</code> is really an <em>associative entity</em> for the <code>Order</code>/<code>Product</code> relationship. Now, if an <code>Order</code> should ever be deleted the <code>OrderItem</code> associations should also be deleted as it has no reason to exist without the associated <code>Order</code>. If the <code>Role</code> is ever deleted all the associated <code>RolePermission</code> associations should also be deleted. An <em>associative entity</em> may also contain any additional data pertaining to the relationship.</p><p>Most many-to-many associations will have a stronger affinity with one of the two sides. It may feel as though you need to have the identifier of the <em>other</em> Aggregate Root in each. For instance, when we take something like a <code>Job</code> and <code>Board</code> would be have a <code>Job</code> contain a list of <code>Board</code> identifiers or a <code>Board</code> contain a list of <code>Job</code> identifiers. Perhaps the link is so significant that we use a <code>JobBoard</code> Value Object or even create it as an Aggregate Root and use the identifiers on one of the ends. Since I&#39;m sure many of us haven&#39;t really considered a scenario like this it may require us to give it quite a bit of thought and discuss this with our Domain Expert.</p><p>Most of us have come across an <code>Order</code> with its <code>OrderItem</code> collection. But if you think about it we actually have a many-to-many relationship here between <code>Order</code> and <code>Product</code>. We typically don&#39;t call the relationship <code>OrderProduct</code> even though in a purely technical sense we could. We usually <em>know</em> that the items are part of an order and make up an <em>aggregate</em>. This is the level of comfort we should strive for in our domain modelling. Given enough time and experience we usually get there but it may take a couple of modelling changes to get there. Always aim to break down associations to a one-to-one or one-to-many structure.</p><p>Whenever one <code>ClassA</code>&#39;s lifetime is dependent on the lifetime of <code>ClassB</code> we can safely say that <code>ClassB</code> is the Aggregate Root of <code>ClassA</code>.</p><h4 id="example-of-deep-hierarchy" tabindex="-1">Example of deep hierarchy <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-of-deep-hierarchy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example of deep hierarchy&quot;">​</a></h4><p>An Aggregate Root is used to represent a consistency boundary. As such it may be necessary to break up a graph that goes too deep. However, you may find situations where the consistency boundaries seem to overlap.</p><p>Consider the following structure:</p><div class="language-c# vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">c#</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">public</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;"> class</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;"> Project</span></span>

If you absolutely <em>have</em> to change more than one aggregate within a transaction you should give it careful thought.</p><p>The reason that this is so important has to do with locking. For higher volume transactions you may run into many more deadlock scenarios when manipulating more than one aggregate in a transaction. Rather attempt to break it into two distinct operations with one leading to the next. This will in all probability require a Process Manager to for the orchestration.</p><p>There are definitely going to be times when you <em>do</em> need to change more than one aggregate within the same transaction.

It is quite conceivable that we can use a Process Manager to accomplish this but, on the other hand, we may need to keep it immediately consistent. You will come across the argument that in the real world the two accounts are typically held by different institutions so eventual consistency is implied. However, in our scenario we are not transferring money between two different bank accounts but rather within our domain.</p><p>This boils down to how sensitive the data is to consistency. If you can get away with eventual consistency then go with a Process Manager; else, for immediate consistency, you may need to bend the rules.</p><h3 id="persistence-requirements-for-changes-to-aggregates" tabindex="-1">Persistence requirements for changes to aggregates <a class="header-anchor" href="#persistence-requirements-for-changes-to-aggregates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Persistence requirements for changes to aggregates&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When not making use of event sourcing you may find some instances where you would like to optimize your persistence by not persisting an entire aggregate.

There is nothing preventing us from sprinkling some hints into our code. When we have an <code>Order</code> with 100 <code>OrderItem</code> instances and we call the <code>.Save(order)</code> method on our <code>OrderRepository</code> it has no choice but to save all those items. When we subsequently change a single order item or add a new one how would our repository save those items? One option is to load all the items from the persistence store and compare them. Another option may be to have some property on our <code>OrderItem</code> such as <code>IsAppended</code>. When we regard our <code>OrderItem</code> as a value object we can replace any <strong>changes</strong> with new items and then when we call the <code>.Save(order)</code> method our repository can loop through the order items and save only the appended items. We would need to still remove any items that have been altered. Here we can either keep a list on the order is add an <code>IsRemoved</code> onto the <code>OrderItem</code>.</p><p>This is all still persistence-ignorant since these <em>hints</em> are not part of any persistence mechanism but part of our domain code that tracks changes.

This technique is only going to work when the Aggregate Root containing the factory method has access to all the Aggregate Roots involved. You may immediately be thinking how that would work since Bounded Contexts should not be referencing each other. The way you&#39;d need to do this is to perform this type of operation using a separate Bounded Context or integration layer that is used to compose the constituent Bounded Contexts or even from a value Object that represents an Aggregate Root from another Bounded Context.</p><h3 id="aggregate-could-contain-a-list-with-thousands-of-entries" tabindex="-1">Aggregate could contain a list with thousands of entries <a class="header-anchor" href="#aggregate-could-contain-a-list-with-thousands-of-entries" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Aggregate could contain a list with thousands of entries&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At times it seems as though your Aggregate Root is going to become too large to load into memory since it contains collections that are huge. The very first thing to remember is that your domain model should <em>not</em> be used for querying. We do not want to load an Aggregate Root for the sole purpose of displaying data. If, however, we have access to an Aggregate Root instance that happens to expose the data we require then we could use the instance but chances are that is only going to work in instances where we are working with the specific Aggregate Root anyway. In you <em>do</em> go with this option do not be tempted to have your domain code return <em>any</em> UI elements.</p><p>Next you have to ask yourself whether you truly need to load the entire collection of related objects by keeping in mind that the main purpose of an Aggregate Root is to enforce invariants and consistency. If you require the collection to enforce uniqueness rather use your data store to do that. Your domain is not the best place for set-based operations.</p><p>Also keep in mind that if the collection is not necessarily going to be contributing to enforcing any invariants then you do not need to load it. Historical data is probably not going to be required.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a hypothetical requirement that a <code>Customer</code> may have a maximum of 5 active orders at any one time. Here we can immediately use a collection of <code>ActiveOrder</code> Value Objects. We may even keep only an <code>ActiveOrderCount</code> on our <code>Customer</code> that is kept up-to-date when order statuses are changed.</p><p>We may even want to check the invariant on the <code>Customer</code>:</p><div class="language-c# vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">c#</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">public</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;"> class</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;"> Customer</span></span>

Had we stored only the <code>CustomerId</code> that too would suffice but there is nothing preventing us from denormalizing the customer&#39;s name into the order.</p><p>Just a note on file size: although we should strive toward keeping things small and manageable there is a difference between file size and class and method sizes. For instance, once we opt to include some Value Objects within our Aggregate Root class as nested classes the Aggregate Root class will be bigger. Moving that nested class out may decrease the size of the file but changes little in respect of the design. It may even make it less fluid. One technique you may wish to employ should your file seem rather unwieldly is to use a <code>partial class</code> in a separate file for your Aggregate Root and then place the nested class in <em>that</em> file.</p><h2 id="invariants" tabindex="-1">Invariants <a class="header-anchor" href="#invariants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Invariants&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We should be adding all the required invariants into our domain model. Some <em>rules</em> may require configurable values and these we can pass in when performing the relevant command. An Aggregate Root cannot do much about factors external to the domain model and you should be cognizant of this fact so that you do not attempt to place every requirement into your domain model. Some invariants may <em>seem</em> as though they belong in your Bounded Context but ensure that you are not trying to implement an invariant in the wrong Bounded Context.</p><p>An example of an external requirement is authorization. I tend to think about a domain model in terms of a physical calculator. It has a keypad with digits, some operators, and a display. If I decide that I want to secure my calculator, I cannot expect my calculator to do so. Anyone gaining access to my calculator can start performing operations provided by the domain model.</p><p>Your domain model should be focused on implementing the <em>business requirements</em> and not any <em>infrastructure</em>, <em>security</em>, <em>performance</em>, or other requirements. If it can aid in achieving these external requirements, then that is first prize but it should be providing deterministic business functionality in a reliable way.</p><p>Any integration layer interacting with the domain has the responsibility to ensure that only authorised actions are permitted.</p><h3 id="invariants-involving-many-aggregate-roots" tabindex="-1">Invariants involving many Aggregate Roots <a class="header-anchor" href="#invariants-involving-many-aggregate-roots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Invariants involving many Aggregate Roots&quot;">​</a></h3><p>An example may be that we cannot create an <code>Order</code> for a <code>Customer</code> that has a status set to <code>Inactive</code>. The first thing to remember is that it is extremely hard to design any software that attempts to prevent a developer from performing a certain task and this should not be your goal. It should be a fluid experience to do the right thing and it should be painful to do the wrong thing. If you can design your software in this way, then any developers making use of your domain model should not be tempted to implement hacks.</p><p>To this end it may be near impossible to prevent a developer from creating a new instance of an <code>Order</code> even if our invariant states that we may not create an <code>Order</code> for a <code>Customer</code> with an <code>Inactive</code> status.

Security concerns are typically applied in the application layer and will not be a domain concern unless you are actually implementing a security-based Bounded Context.</p><h4 id="external-invariants" tabindex="-1">External invariants <a class="header-anchor" href="#external-invariants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;External invariants&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Some invariants may be &quot;twice-removed&quot; (or more). Your domain proper within your Bounded Context cannot do much about these. Typically, these invariants will apply to a process and you can elevate the enforcement thereof to the process manager itself. The invariants will become part of the process manager Bounded Context related to this Bounded Context. For instance, if we have an <code>OrderManagement</code> Bounded Context it will mostly be involved with domain objects within this Bounded Context. However, to implement process managers related to orders we may opt for an <code>OrderProcessManagement</code> bounded context that is also aware of interactions with other Bounded Contexts through, say, a messaging infrastructure.</p><h3 id="always-valid-vs-complete" tabindex="-1">Always valid vs complete <a class="header-anchor" href="#always-valid-vs-complete" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Always valid vs complete&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In general Domain-Driven Design practitioners are of the opinion that all domain objects should be valid at all times. However, it is conceivable that we have different stages to the completeness of our entities that change the validity. This is especially true of most objects involved in a process. If we consider our process manager to be a first-class citizen in its owning Bounded Context, then there may be various statuses involved throughout the lifecycle of the process manager.</p><p>Each of the statuses may require a different set of data and, as such, we can check the invariants when moving to the next status. Again, we can check the invariants in various ways when we do our call to the <code>GoToThisStatus()</code> method.</p><h3 id="apply-invariants-at-the-correct-level" tabindex="-1">Apply invariants at the correct level <a class="header-anchor" href="#apply-invariants-at-the-correct-level" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Apply invariants at the correct level&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As can be seen from the examples given thus far we should strive to apply invariants where they are needed. If we consider something like a <em>rule-engine</em> things can get a bit hairy. In general, you should really only be using a <em>rule-engine</em> on the peripheral edges of your business. You are probably going to be getting the most mileage by using it when integrating with entities outside of your business. It is a kind of generic Anti-Corruption Layer to prevent distorted data from making its way into your business systems. On that note you <em>may</em> hear the argument that you can define a rule once and use it in multiple places. This may be so but you have to ask yourself why you would <em>want</em> to apply the same rule in multiple places. Most invariants belong in a single place.</p><p>Just as we have a <em>system of record</em> for data we may think of our invariants in the same way. There is an authoritative bounded context that is concerned with a particular invariant. Anything applying something along the lines of the invariant outside of that space should be there purely for convenience. This is the same for front-end validation. We should <em>never</em> trust any provider talking to our domain as necessarily providing 100% valid data. An outside bit of code can act as the gatekeeper regarding <em>access</em> to the domain by way of authorization but that is about as far as it goes.</p><h3 id="unique-items-in-collection-e-g-e-mail-address" tabindex="-1">Unique items in collection (e.g. e-mail address) <a class="header-anchor" href="#unique-items-in-collection-e-g-e-mail-address" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unique items in collection (e.g. e-mail address)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In general, you should not attempt to perform set-based validations within the domain as domain entities are focused on individual invariants or small, localized, sets of entities or value objects within an Aggregate Root. The most common example of this is some unique constraint such as a <code>Username</code> or <code>EMailAddress</code> but any key would qualify.</p><h3 id="only-throw-domainexception-in-domain" tabindex="-1">Only throw DomainException in domain <a class="header-anchor" href="#only-throw-domainexception-in-domain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Only throw DomainException in domain&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In most cases you should use a well-defined exception class along the lines of <code>DomainException</code> or <code>BusinessException</code> to identify invariants.</p><h2 id="entities" tabindex="-1">Entities <a class="header-anchor" href="#entities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Entities&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="using-an-identifier-class" tabindex="-1">Using an &quot;Identifier&quot; class <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-an-identifier-class" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using an &quot;Identifier&quot; class&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There really should not be any need for anything in the line of an <code>Identifier</code> class or a base <code>Entity</code> or <code>AggregateRoot</code> class. If we <em>do</em> make use of a framework of sorts it should be a non-intrusive as possible. It is quite conceivable that we may have different identifiers for different entities depending on their use. Typically, we would use the same key format but we may have to upgrade an existing legacy system iteratively and it could be using auto-incrementing <code>int</code> keys whereas we may decide to go with <code>Guid</code> keys going forward.</p><p>From time-to-time you may run across something like this:</p><div class="language-c# vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">c#</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">public</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;"> interface</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;"> IIndentifier</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">&lt;</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">T</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">&gt;</span></span>

Some folks are of the opinion that <code>int</code> keys are faster than <code>Guid</code> keys but I would suggest that this assertion be tested with a good number of records. With the speed of today&#39;s data stores I have not found any noticeable difference in performance. Inserting new data may lead to a slight increase in overhead with <code>Guid</code> keys as they do take up more space and would lead to more index page splits. But with decent re-indexing strategies in place it all boils down to the low-level read IO.</p><p>A <em>major</em> disadvantage I find with auto-incrementing keys is that we cannot assign them up-front so it usually requires a read of sorts after and insert to get the newly assigned key. For example, when using Sql Server one could execute the following:</p><div class="language-sql vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sql</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">insert into</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;"> MyTable</span></span>

It would only require an insert and no subsequent read. This makes it particularly easy to associate data structures in code without relying on the data store to first generate the relevant identifiers.</p><h4 id="making-a-role-explicit" tabindex="-1">Making a role explicit <a class="header-anchor" href="#making-a-role-explicit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Making a role explicit&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Although there is typically very little sense in representing an Aggregate Root or Entity in terms of an interface there are instances where interfaces may prove useful. A naive example may be some role such as <code>IAttributeContainer</code> that represents some behaviour and/or data requirement on the implementer. In this way we can have a domain object fulfil a specific role.</p><h2 id="value-objects" tabindex="-1">Value Objects <a class="header-anchor" href="#value-objects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Value Objects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Value Objects are immutable structures that encapsulate specific data and may contain behaviour. In particular, they are useful when <em>representing</em> an Aggregate Root or associative entity. When you need to represent <em>some</em> Aggregate Roots that belong to an upstream Bounded Context it is possible to duplicate the required data in your own Bounded Context or to obtain the required data by means of an Anti-Corruption Layer. The structures are then represented in an immutable form in the guise of Value Objects in the relevant Bounded Context.</p><h3 id="shared-value-objects" tabindex="-1">Shared Value Objects <a class="header-anchor" href="#shared-value-objects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shared Value Objects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I have run into scenarios where I have the exact same Value Object used by more than one Aggregate Root. You might think this strange but in my calculation engine I have something I call a <code>Constraint</code>. A <code>Constraint</code> has an <code>Argument</code>, a <code>Name</code>, and a <code>Value</code>. The <code>Name</code> represents the type of comparison that I would like to perform such as <code>Equals</code>, <code>From</code>, <code>To</code>, or <code>NotEqualTo</code> and can be extended as need be. The <code>Value</code> can be any applicable value. As an example I may want to constrain the argument <em>Age</em> by applying constraint <em>From</em> with a value of <em>21</em>.</p><p>I now have an Aggregate Root called <code>Calculation</code> that can contain a number of <code>Constraint</code> Value Objects. My <code>Formula</code> Aggregate Root can <em>also</em> contain a number of <code>Constraint</code> Value Objects. I store my <code>Constraint</code> Value Objects in a data store along with an <code>OwnerName</code> and an <code>OwnerId</code>. In this way I can fetch the appropriate list of <code>Constraint</code> Value Objects.</p><p>One way to reconstitute the two Aggregate Roots applicable here along with the <code>Constraint</code> Value Objects would be to have each Repository build the <code>Constraint</code> objects itself. There would be duplication and this is something we do not want. Having a <code>ConstraintRepository</code> seems odd as the <code>Constraint</code> is neither an Aggregate Root not an Entity. The answer may lie in a <code>ConstraintFactory</code> that is used by both the <code>CalculationRepository</code> <em>and</em> the <code>FormulaRepository</code>. In keeping with the guideline that factories are useful in cases where building up the resultant object involves some complexity, we may opt to <em>not</em> use a factory if the Value Object is only one or two attributes. But it is up to you. Our <code>ConstraintFactory</code> could run off to the data store to fetch and build up the required Value Object or list of objects and return them to the caller.</p><p>However, the fact that you even have a shared Value Object may indicate something that you missed in your design. In my case I simplified the structure down to only have a <code>Formula</code> and no more <code>Calculation</code>. The <code>Calculation</code> concept was more of a <em>classification</em> that could just as easily be represented by a <code>Formula</code> with some fancy footwork. Be on the lookout for this type of thing. Your design may need another look.</p><h2 id="structure-vs-classification" tabindex="-1">Structure vs Classification <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure-vs-classification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure vs Classification&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In line with the Shared Value Object thinking it is important to note that we should strive to not include classification in our structural design.</p><p>For instance, if we have a <code>Customer</code> but our domain experts insist that we have <code>Gold</code>, <code>Silver</code>, and <code>Bronze</code> customers we <em>may</em> be tempted to model it as such given the Ubiquitous Language. We could have the following structures:</p><div class="language-c# vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">c#</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">public</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;"> class</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;"> GoldCustomer</span></span>

In any event, tomorrow they may decide to include a <code>Platinum</code> customer.</p><p>Let&#39;s take the example of an electrical plug. Our Domain Expert tells us that we may have a red, a green, and a blue plug. After some discussion we come to the conclusion that these plugs all fit the same wall socket and only the colour differs. That seems pretty much like a classification with very little bearing on rules and/or behaviour. Now another Domain Expert starts talking about a European, an American, and a South African plug. This changes things since they all fit different wall sockets. There may be rules associated with these since they are only going to work in certain countries or with certain socket adapters. There may even be a whole to and fro with regards to rules:</p><p>Expert A: &quot;Each plug can only be sold in the relevant country.&quot; Expert B: &quot;What about customers that need to buy a plug for a country they are going to visit?&quot; Expert A: &quot;Fair point.&quot; Expert C: &quot;We could show a warning to a user buying from a country where the plug will not fit a wall socket in order that we don&#39;t have unnecessary returns.&quot;</p><p>We could go off and define these various plug <em>types</em> as domain objects and add intricate rules but after even more discussion it turns out that we do not only deal with electrical plugs but a variety of products. This changes things even more. We now have need to define rules around some <code>Product</code> Aggregate Root. These rules may be rather fluid and we may need to define them in such a manner as to allow them to be added to only certain products. The issue with adding fluid rules into code is that they are not <em>invariant</em> and would require changes to the code base every-so-often as, and when, these rules need amending.</p><p>It is important to only code true invariants as hard-coded rules. In South Africa we have had a VAT (Value-Added Tax) rate of 14% since its introduction. We would most certainly <em>not</em> want to hard code that as an invariant since it <em>can</em> change. It <em>may</em> never change but the very low probability that it could does exist. On the other hand, we have 15 players in a rugby team. That is an <em>invariant</em> as changing the number of players in a team would mean a new sport. If something like that did actually happen it would be something that no-one could foresee and the changes to systems, computerised or otherwise, would be justified.</p><h2 id="is-it-a-value-object-or-an-aggregate-root" tabindex="-1">Is it a Value Object or an Aggregate Root? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-it-a-value-object-or-an-aggregate-root" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is it a Value Object or an Aggregate Root?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There are times when it isn&#39;t apparent as to whether an object is an Aggregate Root or a Value Object. The example that typically comes up is that of an <code>Address</code>. This is where we need guidance from a Domain Expert. They may not know whether a domain object is an Aggregate Root or not but from talking to a Domain Expert we should be able to determine whether or not we are interested in a specific instance of the object.</p><p>When dealing with a physical property of sorts, such as perhaps a deeds office or fixed line phone company would, then an address may very well be an Aggregate Root since a fixed line is probably going to be a semi-permanent feature of an address.</p><p>However, a delivery address on an <code>Order</code> most probably will not be an Aggregate Root but rather a Value Object.</p><h2 id="factory-inheritance-entity-value-object-vs-internal-operation-specific-interface" tabindex="-1">Factory / Inheritance (Entity / Value Object) vs internal / operation specific interface <a class="header-anchor" href="#factory-inheritance-entity-value-object-vs-internal-operation-specific-interface" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Factory / Inheritance (Entity / Value Object) vs internal / operation specific interface&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A <em>Factory</em> is rather useful when we need data from other objects such as repositories when creating a required object. In cases where a specific object contains enough state internally so that it can create our required object we could implement a <em>Factory Method</em> within the class while keeping in mind that we do not want to be injecting things like repositories or services into the factory method.</p><p>A factory may, at times, even require a dependency injection container to perform its work. In cases such as this it is best to use your <em>Composition Root</em> to provide the factory with an instance, preferably through an abstraction, of the DI container.

There are also alternatives to storing data in a relational form in order to avoid the impedance mismatch associated with object to relational mapping. Object databases made a brief appearance but never seemed to live up to the promise although I&#39;m sure there are successful implementations. Document databases and <em>NoSql</em> data stores appear to be quite the rage and may alleviate some of the pain. However, there are pros and cons to any approach and relational databases have proven to be a rather good general-purpose fit.</p><p>Event Sourcing refers to a mechanism where data is not stored in a traditional way. For the most part we have persisted objects and other structures as <em>records</em>. These have been a single entry in a table or any other store and we tend to save the entire <em>entity</em> in one go. These are database entities and not Domain-Driven Design entities even though they share the name. Even if we only change part of the database entity it is still regarded as <em>entity-based</em> interaction. This means that should two users interact with the same <em>entity</em> at the same time we need to start dealing with concurrency issues. Well, concurrency issues never go away totally but we can mitigate it by narrowing the surface area. The less overlap our interaction has with that of any other user the better. The chances that two users are going to be calling in to change the address on the same entity are rather slim.</p><p>With event sourcing we store the domain events in the same sequence that they happened. An event equates to the result of a <em>task-based</em> interaction such as <code>CustomerMovedEvent</code>. We then play back the series of events for a given aggregate in order to restore the state of the Aggregate Root. Think about your bank account for a minute. If your bank came to you and said that they will not be storing your transactions but will, after each transaction, only update your balance I&#39;m quite sure that it is not going to be acceptable. We rather like having that list of transactions along with an opening balance for the month. This enables us to track exactly what money was moved and when. Yet for some obscure reason we are quite happy doing that to our data in general. We save the current state and how we got there is totally disregarded. Over the years we have had heuristic mechanisms in the form of <em>logs</em> and <em>audit trails</em> that indicate how we got to the state that we are in but these are quite often lacking in some form unless particular attention is brought to them.</p><p>Event Sourcing brings the auditing front-and-center in that it the source of truth. It is our list of <em>transactions</em>. In most cases folks immediately have some concerns and questions:</p><ul><li>Isn&#39;t this going to get rather slow over time?</li><li>How do I query this list of events?</li><li>Where are my foreign keys and unique constraints?</li></ul><p>These are all valid questions but the challenges are most certainly not insurmountable.</p><h4 id="dealing-with-a-large-number-of-events" tabindex="-1">Dealing with a large number of events <a class="header-anchor" href="#dealing-with-a-large-number-of-events" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dealing with a large number of events&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Back to your bank account. You do not receive a statement every month containing all your transactions from the day your account became active. Instead each month starts with an opening balance. That is a heuristic called a <em>snapshot</em>. What would happen if the bank happened to lose all opening/closing balances for your account? Nothing. They would simply &quot;rebuild&quot; them from the existing transactions. This is exactly how you could approach your event store. You could create snapshots containing a summary of your entire Aggregate Root whenever required. To rebuild your Aggregate Root, you would load the last snapshot and apply any new events after that point. Snapshots work along the lines of the <em>momento pattern</em>.</p><p>Some event stores save only a single snapshot and rebuild from there. if you can use an event store that includes the snapshots as part of the event stream you may gain some benefit in that you could store various snapshots that make sense to your domain and rebuild from that particular snapshot.</p><h4 id="querying-the-event-store" tabindex="-1">Querying the event store <a class="header-anchor" href="#querying-the-event-store" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Querying the event store&quot;">​</a></h4><p>An event store shares some similarity to a messaging queue and in such an environment you would not query a queue and there would be little sense in doing so. Although there would probably be more sense in querying an event store it is also something that you should try to avoid. Even if you could you would need some form of tooling and it would probably be closer to an operational task than an everyday run-of-the-mill function in your application. The events are serialized objects that contain the outcome of an action and as such need to be transformed into something more readable.</p><p>This is where <em><strong>Event Projection</strong></em> comes to the fore. Event Projection can be thought of as a cursor running over each and every event in your event store. There are some mechanisms to perhaps skip over certain event types but for the most part we would be scanning over the entire set. The job of a projection is to take an event and denormalize the data into a <em>read model</em> that can be easily queried. This would then be used by your front-end or reporting Bounded Context to access the required data.</p><p>Each individual projection runs through each event in sequence but different projections can be run in parallel. For instance, we may have a <em>Customer</em> projection and a <em>Product</em> projection. Should we discover some error in our projection code we could quite easily create a new projection with the fix and run through it. Once it has caught up to the head of the event store we could disable the erroneous projection and enable our new projection.</p><p>Events should be clustered around the Aggregate Root identifier as we need to reconstitute an Aggregate Root from all the events related to that identifier. Projections, on the other hand, run using some global sequence number that runs across <em>all</em> the events in the event store.</p><h4 id="unique-constraints-and-foreign-keys" tabindex="-1">Unique Constraints and Foreign Keys <a class="header-anchor" href="#unique-constraints-and-foreign-keys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unique Constraints and Foreign Keys&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Since there is no way to tell whether a particular event contains unique data without running through the entire event store we need some other place to store any unique values. Any indexing mechanism will do but it has to be used in isolation and may not even necessarily be part of the event store; although some would certainly provide such a mechanism as a convenience.</p><h4 id="querying-possibilities-by-way-of-a-cricket-baseball-example" tabindex="-1">Querying possibilities by way of a cricket/baseball example <a class="header-anchor" href="#querying-possibilities-by-way-of-a-cricket-baseball-example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Querying possibilities by way of a cricket/baseball example&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In the sport &quot;cricket&quot; the scoring is rather detailed. So-much-so that it actually closely resembles event sourcing. Now, it is most certainly possible to store only the outcome of the game with a summary of the wickets taken, extras, balls bowled, etc. However, the scorers typically record the events around each and every ball bowled. This allows one to come up with totally new queries such as &quot;how many times did a bowler take three wickets in the second over of a test match on the second day?&quot;. In this same way we may be able to answer a business query such as &quot;how many customers moved more than once in the last five years?&quot; for our customer management system when we use event sourcing. Again, there are perhaps other ways to get to the data for such a query in a more traditional way, <em>if</em> we were storing some semblance of the data somewhere. But with event sourcing we could create a new projection and run it over the history of our event store at any time in the future.</p><p>Another bat-and-ball game that this could apply to is &quot;baseball&quot;. If the data concerned with every pitch is stored, we could ask a brand new query such as &quot;how many times have the bases been filled in the fifth inning on the fifth pitch?&quot;. Without event sourcing such a query would probably be impossible to answer.</p><h3 id="messaging" tabindex="-1">Messaging <a class="header-anchor" href="#messaging" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Messaging&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Any time we deal with domain events and we need inter-process communication we are going to require some messaging infrastructure. It may be possible to roll your own that targets a specific queuing mechanism. This is fine but you may want to consider using a service bus of sorts. There are many distributed service bus options in the .Net space such as Shuttle.Esb, MassTransit, NServiceBus, and Rebus (and I&#39;m sure there may be more). These mechanisms buy you quite a bit out-of-the-box. At the most basic level they provide an abstraction over a queue by placing a message onto a queue and then having some process that reads that message out of the queue and passed it to some message handler that processes it.</p><p>It is important to note that messages are plain data transfer objects and exhibit no behaviour. If you ever <em>do</em> find that you would like to add some auxiliary method to the message, I&#39;d recommend an extension method since some methods may interfere with your serialization implementation.</p><p>In this way you may send a <em>command</em> telling your domain to do something:</p><div class="language-c# vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">c#</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">public</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;"> class</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;"> RegisterMemberCommand</span></span>

I agree 100% with the event store providing the <em>domain events</em> but I would not agree that it replaces the need for a service bus fully. Of course I have a dog in the fight so I am quite biased. However, as events go into the event store each may have a <code>DatePublished</code> stored along with the event in the relevant store. The <code>DatePublished</code> is not part of the event but rather forms part of the infrastructure. The <code>DatePublished</code> would start out as a <code>NULL</code>. There would be some processor that picks up any events that have not yet been published and then publishes them using the service bus. The relevant event entry then has the <code>DatePublished</code> set.</p><h2 id="integrating-bounded-contexts" tabindex="-1">Integrating Bounded Contexts <a class="header-anchor" href="#integrating-bounded-contexts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Integrating Bounded Contexts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When we decouple our Bounded Contexts, and other software components, to the desired level it may require some additional thinking in terms of how we integrate them again. Looking at that sentence it seems quite odd to pull things apart and then having to think about how to put them back together. At the end of the day it boils down the properly identifying cohesive units that perform individual bits of functionality well. These should be easier to test since we should aim to keep the number of interactions low. To illustrate keeping interactions low I can use an example I have seen that deals with traditional dice. If we throw a single die we can have 6 outcomes. If we pick up two dice we can have six to the power of two options, so 6 x 6 = 36. Now if we had to pick up three dice we would have 6 x 6 x 6 which would leave us with 216 options. As we can see, this can get out of hand pretty quickly. What if we could split these into individual interactions? Then we would have 3 x 6 options which would be 18. Quite a bit easier to work with.</p><p>When integrating Bounded Contexts, we are going to either require data from another Bounded Context or request another Bounded Context to perform some action. Defining those edges clearly and keeping them as far apart as possible is going to go a long way in reasoning about the interactions.</p><h3 id="querying-our-read-model" tabindex="-1">Querying our Read Model <a class="header-anchor" href="#querying-our-read-model" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Querying our Read Model&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The query side of our domain is along the lines of old-school OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) albeit less warehouse-, or, analytically-focused but most definitely geared towards being optimized for reading/querying of data.</p><p>In order to query our read model, we would need to expose it somehow.

As an example we may request that a quote or report be generated. Once complete some notification mechanism makes its way to the front-end where we then issue a <code>GET</code> request to return the result using, most probably, some unique identifier. This may work equally well to perform saved searches where we issue a <code>POST</code> containing search criteria. Once the search has completed the front-end is notified that the search is complete and the requested data is returned. This mechanism should only be used in specific scenarios where the search is required to be saved and may be computationally expensive to perform. Typically, a simple request/response style <code>GET</code> request should suffice.</p><h3 id="sending-commands-to-our-domain-model" tabindex="-1">Sending Commands to our Domain Model <a class="header-anchor" href="#sending-commands-to-our-domain-model" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sending Commands to our Domain Model&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The domain model is more aligned to old-school OLTP (Online Transaction Processing).

You would expose the Aggregate Root method via an API of the Bounded Context and this may include domain services. A Web/Rest API could also be used where you could issue a <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> verb to perform the relevant processing.

In some instance that data may manifest as an Entity or Aggregate Root in-and-of-itself in <em>our</em> Bounded Context. For instance, the <em>Finance</em> Bounded Context may contain a list of assets and when a new asset is added the <em>Maintenance</em> Bounded Context is notified via an event. However, we store our <code>MaintenanceItem</code> as an Aggregate Root since we are able create arbitrary <code>MaintenanceItem</code> entries ourselves. When we <em>do</em> create a new <code>MaintenanceItem</code> Aggregate Root from a new asset we would add some indicator in order to be aware of that link should we receive other events from the <em>Finance</em>, or other, Bounded Context that requires us to take some action on our <code>MaintenanceItem</code> relate to a specific asset.</p><p>The same goes for a Value Object.

I find project folders particularly useful in such cases and you may opt to namespace your classes based on those folder structures.</p><p>I tend to create a solution for each Bounded Context.

It is also quite often the case that many of these concepts are not really new and it may at times be quite difficult to nail down a proper definition.</p><p>Micoroservices is one of those tricky things that <em>feel</em> as though it should be profound but I doubt whether it really is. When it comes to software re-use we are going to be dealing with deployment units. As stated elsewhere this ranges from copying code or a file, linking to a file, or even using an assembly in a separate package. Microservices are more closely related to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in that they provide a service of some kind. Even so, any SOA is going to be something that, on a logical level, provides loosely-coupled services. It seems as though Microservices aim to have more finely-grained services than one would typically find in a SOA where there seems to have been a higher regard for coarse-grained interfaces.</p><p>I have seen a very good presentation by Eric Evans about how Bounded Contexts map quite nicely into this style. Now, a Bounded Context may not be &quot;micro&quot; by any stretch of the imagination but a single Bounded Context most certainly should be a deployment unit if one takes into consideration that one could regard anything from the front-end, and reporting, all the way to process management as Bounded Contexts this certainly would hold true. Of course if one were to take something like reporting it would also be vertically sliced along various Bounded Contexts. For example, reporting for Accounting, Product, Orders, etc.</p><p>I tend to take more of a separation-of-concerns view to these things rather that to try and name them using the latest term. If any term does assist in expressing the concept, then that is first prize.</p><p>It may be that the idea behind microservices fit more closely to generic subdomains where there is a very acute focus on re-use given their generic nature. If we can identify such generic parts within our domain, it would greatly improve re-use and fit in nicely with the microservices ideal. However, it takes a great deal of understanding of a domain (or several) in order to identify these moving bits.</p><h2 id="command-query-responsibility-segregation-cqrs" tabindex="-1">Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) <a class="header-anchor" href="#command-query-responsibility-segregation-cqrs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Many people see CQRS and immediately assume that it implies, or is the same thing as, Event Sourcing. If you are familiar with the difference you may wish to skip this section.</p><p>CQRS has its roots in the concept of Command-Query Separation suggested by Bertrand Meyer. The basic concept to understand when it comes to CQRS is that you separate your commands/actions from your queries/reads. This sounds like common sense and we tend to believe that we are already doing so. However, if you ever find yourself querying your domain model then you are not practicing CQRS.</p><p>There are probably going to be instances where you find that all the information you require can be exposed by your Aggregate Root and in such situations it is probably okay to do so. These situations are typically limited to those where you require data from a single Aggregate Root. Anything related to display or lists usually would require a query layer. This is where CQRS shines. You may even opt to denormalize some data in your read store.</p><p>Many folks also believe that CQRS implies <em>eventual consistency</em> but this is not necessarily the case. There are a number of ways you can approach CQRS.</p><ul><li>Read from the same table in the same data store.</li><li>Read from another table in the same data store.</li><li>Read from a dedicated data store optimized for querying.</li></ul><p>You may also decide to have certain queryable data 100% consistent whilst others may be eventually consistent. If you can get away with eventual consistency the scalability of your system will probably benefit. However, there are some scenarios where we are going to need 100% consistency between the query data and the transactional data. An example is a bank balance. It is, of course, totally possible to use eventual consistency and may very well be acceptable but it will depend on the use case. Assume that two people have an ATM card for the same account and both decide to withdraw the last $100 from the account using different ATM machines at, as luck would have it, the <em>same</em> time. The command to withdraw is sent to the server and the balance is checked before issuing the money. If both transactions are successful the account will be overdrawn and, in our case, this is not permitted. There may be arguments either way but you are going to run into these situations and they need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>That being said, you should make every effort to explain to your Domain Expert that not every action in the system requires 100% consistency. In real life we have many examples where we are waiting for something to happen asynchronously. For some odd reason many people have an expectation that a computerised system has infinite resources and that just isn&#39;t true. When applying for a passport, for instance, you fill in your application form and go to the submission counter. Your form is validated and once found to be complete you are expected to pay some fee. Your request message (application) is then sent off for some processing and you take with you some document as proof of your application and payment and go home. Very few people end up standing at the counter waiting for their passport to come back immediately. Sometime later you are notified by e-mail or text message that your passport is ready for collection. This is an eventually consistent and asynchronous process. We do these things all the time and we need to get our Domain Experts to get on board with this kind of thinking.</p><h3 id="query-namespace-for-query-objects" tabindex="-1">Query namespace for query objects <a class="header-anchor" href="#query-namespace-for-query-objects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Query namespace for query objects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are times when you need a dedicated read model. These classes are also referred to as Data Transfer Objects. A separate query layer is recommended and if you follow some of this guidance you may end up with a read model that feels as though it should have the same name as your Aggregate Root. Since your read model is closely related to querying you may decide to keep it in the same assembly where your repository infrastructure components live. You may opt for a separate assembly containing but if they do happen to be in one assembly and you find conflicts with naming an option is to namespace the read models.</p><div class="language-c# vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">c#</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">namespace</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;"> Company</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">.</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">BoundedContext</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">.</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">DataAccess</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">.</span><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">Query</span></span>

You most certainly should get the data back to your user but probably in a more round-about way. For instance, assume that your user would like a sales forecast for a given period. This may require some serious <em>processing</em> and domain logic. In this case you should design the system such that the user can issue a <em>request</em> for the forecast and, once it has been completed, the system will notify the user that the report/forecast has been completed and that the data can be viewed. This frees up the server to schedule the work and the user can continue with other tasks in the meantime.</p><p>Such a mechanism may be appropriate for general reporting even when no additional processing is required. If we run into a situation where 200 users decide that they need to view their report at the same time and we process all reporting requests immediately then our reporting and database servers are definitely going to be taking strain. However, if a request for a report is issued and placed on a queue using a service bus or some custom-rolled queuing we could have our reporting server endpoint handle, say, a maximum of 5 concurrent report requests. This places less strain on the computing resources and improves the user experience for all users.</p><h2 id="application-and-domain-services" tabindex="-1">Application and Domain Services <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-and-domain-services" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application and Domain Services&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A <em>domain service</em> should be used when interacting with multiple domain objects or having behaviour that does not seem to fit on any single class.</p><p>An <em>application service</em> is typically a coarse-grained service that wraps various operations on the domain model. It should not contain any business logic. To this end I do not find too much use in these and would only use an application service if the need arises. There are folks that reckon that the effort is so small that one may as well add these from the get-go but if I don&#39;t need it immediately I&#39;d spend that same small effort if-and-when I do.</p><p>Domain and application services may be implemented to perform a single function, such as <code>Execute</code> à la the <em>Command Pattern</em>, or it may be more coarse-grained where there would be a method per function, such as <code>Take()</code>, <code>Confirm()</code>, <code>Dispatch()</code>. This is more of a preference than having any particular impact on system design; although having to only perform a single function is going to lead to smaller classes and will aid in achieving the <em>Single Responsibility Principle</em>.</p><p>In order to avoid using namespaces to identify domain and application services one could use a suffix of <code>Service</code> for the domain and <code>Task</code> for the application service.</p><h3 id="note-on-processes" tabindex="-1">Note on processes <a class="header-anchor" href="#note-on-processes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Note on processes&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In many cases where we are using a domain or application service it may be to complete some sequential process. You may very well find yourself interacting with multiple Aggregate Roots in a single transaction. It is possible to break up such a process into its distinct steps and implement a message-based process manager. The process manager will become a first-class citizen in your domain and keep track of the process. This may seem like a bit more work but there are going to be pros and cons to this approach and given your project constraints and requirements you will have to make a pragmatic call on this.</p><h2 id="deleting" tabindex="-1">Deleting <a class="header-anchor" href="#deleting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Deleting&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For the most part we should aim to not ever delete any data in the transactional data. If there is a need to delete any data in order to replace it then that operation should always be in a database transaction. If your data store does not support transactions, then go with a journal approach where you write first and <em>then</em> delete. If you are using Referential Integrity, it typically only needs to exist on your transactional store.</p><p>Your read store is another matter. No Referential Integrity is necessarily required although you may wish to configure cascading deletes.</p><p>If you are using only a single data store for both transactional and read operations, then you would go with the guidelines around the transactional data store.</p><h1 id="techniques-technologies-and-questions" tabindex="-1">Techniques, Technologies, and Questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#techniques-technologies-and-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Techniques, Technologies, and Questions&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="orms" tabindex="-1">ORMs <a class="header-anchor" href="#orms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ORMs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When making use of a relational database to persist your domain objects you may be considering the use of an Object-Relational Mapper such as NHibernate or Entity Framework. Even though you are <em>always</em> going to be performing object-relational mapping in the sense of the <strong>Data Mapper</strong> pattern you may find that adding another layer in the form of ORM tooling may add even more mapping to the mix.</p><p>You may find that there is a sufficient disconnect between your domain structure and your database structure that you are going to need database-specific versions of the entities. You may also find that your tooling requires you to structure certain parts of your domain model in a specific way that may not be what you want.</p><p>I am no proponent of ORMs and would suggest that you use Ado.Net directly for your data mapping.</p><h2 id="why-can-an-address-sometimes-be-an-aggregate-root-and-other-times-a-value-object" tabindex="-1">Why can an Address sometimes be an Aggregate Root and other times a Value Object? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-can-an-address-sometimes-be-an-aggregate-root-and-other-times-a-value-object" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why can an Address sometimes be an Aggregate Root and other times a Value Object?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Every-so-often the question of whether an address is an Aggregate Root or a Value Object seems to pop up somewhere. You <em>may</em> have folks argue either way and present their case but for the most part it is going to depend on the use of the <code>Address</code>. This is why there may be confusion.</p><p>Any business that has infrastructure with a termination point at a physical address may regard an <code>Address</code> as an Aggregate Root. Examples may be fixed telephone line operators, fibre providers, or security companies that place a radio on your premises.</p><p>On the other hand, our online shop may require an address in order to deliver the box of electrical plugs you ordered. In this case they are not interested in the lifetime of the address and the <code>Address</code> is a Value Object.</p><p>It may be that you have <em>both</em> scenarios in your domain. In such a case you may wish to name them appropriately. For example, our Aggregate Root may be <code>TerminationAddress</code> and our Value Object <code>PhysicalAddress</code>.</p><h2 id="making-the-system-do-a-lot-of-work-vs-making-the-user-do-a-lot-of-work" tabindex="-1">Making the system do a lot of work vs. making the user do a lot of work <a class="header-anchor" href="#making-the-system-do-a-lot-of-work-vs-making-the-user-do-a-lot-of-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Making the system do a lot of work vs. making the user do a lot of work&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In many situations it takes a lot of effort to make things simple for a user. Typically, various individual functions can be grouped into tasks for a user in order to have the system perform the heavy lifting. having individual functions may enable users to perform the various functions in different ways allowing an <em>out-of-band</em> process of sorts. However, having processes implemented as first-class citizens does add a useful structure to your solution. You may even go with a hybrid approach where some steps require user intervention to continue.</p><h2 id="object-state-vs-object-type-vs-object-lifetime" tabindex="-1">Object State vs. Object Type vs. Object Lifetime <a class="header-anchor" href="#object-state-vs-object-type-vs-object-lifetime" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Object State vs. Object Type vs. Object Lifetime&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The objects within our broader domain change as time goes by. These changes need to be handled correctly; it may be quite easy to apply the <em>State Pattern</em> incorrectly to such a situation. The correct way to use the <em>State Pattern</em> is when using the same object but indicating what that object is currently doing. The archetypal sample of this pattern is the vending machine. As actions take place within the machine so the state transitions occur. The vending machine, however, stays a vending machine.</p><p>Now how about an egg? Is it a chicken in another state? Let&#39;s say we want to track all our eggs. Each is assigned a number. Then one-day egg number 1 ‘dies’. Do we care about the egg? How about the cost of getting the egg to the point it was before it ‘died’? The next day egg number 2 hatches. Do we care about this egg? It no longer exists. We do care about chicken number 1, though. But after six weeks, chicken number one becomes roast chicken number 20. The chicken is gone.</p><p>This is where CQRS can play a role. In our transaction store we could start with the two eggs and track all the required information and reporting data in the reporting store. Once egg number 1 dies we can remove it from the transaction store. All the historical data remains in the reporting store. However, the <em>state</em> of that egg has probably changed to ‘dead’ though. The same goes for egg number 2. Its state changed to ‘hatched’; but suddenly we now have a chicken added to our chicken repository. Once the chicken is roasted we can remove the chicken from our checking repository in the transactional store since all the audit data is still in the query store and the chicken is, well, history. But now we have an extra item added to the <code>RoastedChickenRepository</code>.</p><p>The same idea goes for a <code>Quote</code> leading to an <code>Order</code> leading to an <code>Invoice</code> leading a <code>PaymentReceivedTransaction</code>; each living and dying as it transitions along the path. Each entity has a lifecycle in our transaction store. The reporting store never forgets (well, it doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to) and is the keeper of all things good and bad that happened.</p><h2 id="code-comments" tabindex="-1">Code Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#code-comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Code Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I am in the camp that proposes no comments.

These type of arguments I tend to equate to the following, rather old, riddle:</p><p>Three friends go to the same café lunch each day and one day their bill amounts to $30. They each give the waiter $10 but at the till the manager tells the waiter that these people are such good customers that they are going to get a discount of $5. The waiter turns out to be somewhat of a criminal and decides to keep $2 for himself. He goes back to the table and hands each customer $1. Now, if each of the three customers paid $9 that would be 3 * $9 which would be equal to $27. The waiter has $2. $27 + $2 is equal to $29. Where did the other $1 go? The answer lies in the fact that the calculation is approach from different, incorrect, angles. The customers did not pay $27 but $25. The discount was $5 (3 x $1 + $2).</p><p>I believe that we need to <em>not</em> only know what to do from a business point-of-view but also <em>how</em> to do it. They certainly should not be trying to tell us <em>how</em> to do it from a <em>technical</em> point-of-view. The technical implementation is up to us but if we do not know how to solve the business case on a logical level there is going to be a disconnect between the business concepts and the technical solution. This may be why we run into so many situations where the business folks say that the solution isn&#39;t anywhere near what they asked for.</p><h2 id="scalability-maintainability-reusability-reachability" tabindex="-1">Scalability, Maintainability, Reusability, Reachability <a class="header-anchor" href="#scalability-maintainability-reusability-reachability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scalability, Maintainability, Reusability, Reachability&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Most <em>-ilities</em> can be summed up as &quot;how easy is it <em>to do</em>?&quot;. These things are typically quite difficult to measure and may, in fact, add to technical debt quite a bit if not considered carefully when architecting your solution. These are broader design issues that do not necessarily affect any of your domain modelling. However, having a domain model eases <em>all</em> of these factors.</p><p>Most domain models, irrespective of maturity, are going to be quite simple to expose via any integration interface and since you can make use of the domain model from anywhere you are going to be able to scale quite nicely. Security, however, is an application concern that should be outside the domain model.</p><h2 id="complex-vs-advanced" tabindex="-1">Complex vs Advanced <a class="header-anchor" href="#complex-vs-advanced" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Complex vs Advanced&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Lastly, I&#39;d like to again mention this bit. I have run into many folks that are of the opinion that domain modelling is too complex. A domain model represents business requirements. Never start out looking at domain modelling code. If you understand the business requirements, then the domain model will make sense. Domain modelling may be somewhat more <em>advanced</em> than traditional options but it is not in-and-of-itself complex. Once understood and with sufficient experience quite the contrary may be true.</p><h1 id="epilogue" tabindex="-1">Epilogue <a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Epilogue&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this guidance.
