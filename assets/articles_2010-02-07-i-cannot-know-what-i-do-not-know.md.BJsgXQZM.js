Now whenever there is a paradigm shift one inevitably goes back to the Novice level. The fact that one has been doing something A for 10 years <em>may</em> not count for much when I move to something B. I say <em>may</em> not because A and B may be related, so I may not end up way back on the Novice level.</p><hr><p>I think the fact that software development is such an immensely broad field makes it terribly difficult to guage who fits in where. Coupled to this is the fact that software development is only a means to an end. That end is the automation of some domain that, in most cases, has absolutely nothing to do with software development: e.g. Accounting, Inventory, Steel Sheet Cutting, Medicine, Asset Management, etc.</p><p>It is also extremely difficult to <em>convince</em> someone that they are on the wrong path.

Maybe that is why like-minded individuals are required in very small teams to get the job done.</p>',6),s=[i];function h(r,l,c,d,m,f){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const _=e(a,[["render",h]]);export{w as __pageData,_ as default};
