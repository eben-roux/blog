You&#39;re looking at a high-difficulty problem at the edge of current capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>I may not be an accomplished musician, but I have dabbled a bit and it is something I have enjoyed doing. It started way back in high school, around 1989, when I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sound Blaster</a> card and the DOS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cakewalk_(sequencer)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cakewalk</a> sequencer to &quot;automate&quot; my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/95rgj0/the_other_unsung_portasound_hero_pss680_is_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Yamaha PSS 680</a>.</p><p>When I like a song I sometimes like to create my own version of it. Recreating the song from scratch is rather time consuming, although finding the notes comes quite easily to someone like Doctor Mix. Another option is to try to find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MIDI</a> file that contains something resembling the original.</p><p>Having a computer take the original recording and output the notes would, of course, be first prize.</p><h2 id="limits" tabindex="-1">Limits <a class="header-anchor" href="#limits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limits&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Artificial intelligence systems are crunching numbers. They do not &quot;hear&quot;. For AI to &quot;make sense&quot; of a bunch of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s representing sound waves and then bring that back to actual notes is... not easy.</p><p>What I also found fascinating about the Doctor Mix recreation is seeing just how DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and VST (Virtual Studio Technology) software has evolved. The fact that a single &quot;sound&quot; may actually consist of a number of waveforms means that identifying these as part of the same track is rather tricky. All the knobs and levers means that music production is truly an art and it seems to have become quite a bit more complex over the years, at least in the digital space. I guess that back in the analog days things were quite a bit different.</p><p>Perhaps part of the AI problem is that humans are analog creatures and that we do not need all the information on the Internet before we can ride a bike.</p><p>Then again, can a computer ride a bike?</p><hr><p>Since AI responses will invariably vary going forward, below is the full ChatGPT response as it was produced on 4 May 2025 around 8h30.</p><h2 id="can-ai-convert-a-song-audio-file-to-a-multi-track-midi-file" tabindex="-1">Can AI Convert a Song Audio File to a Multi-Track MIDI File? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-ai-convert-a-song-audio-file-to-a-multi-track-midi-file" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can AI Convert a Song Audio File to a Multi-Track MIDI File?&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="in-theory" tabindex="-1">In Theory <a class="header-anchor" href="#in-theory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;In Theory&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes — AI could attempt this.
