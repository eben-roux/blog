However, part of all that abstraction and code reuse is to make it easier to understand. If a human has to check the code produced by an LLM, it better be understandable.</p><h2 id="what-i-think" tabindex="-1">What I think... <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-i-think" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What I think...&quot;">​</a></h2><p>My experience with LLMs has been hit-and-miss. Boilerplate code is great, but I&#39;ve had to fix the code produced more often than not. I recently asked ChatGPT and Mistral to help me with integration code for SharePoint, and they both were quite adamant that it is possible to authenticate using an Azure App Registration client ID and secret. From what I can tell, one would need to use a certificate. I usually end up searching the Internet when I just cannot get the LLM to produce working code.</p><blockquote><p>NB! Not a real doctor... But I&#39;ll still tell you what&#39;s wrong with you - Dr. Noob</p></blockquote><p>Another factor is trust. Are we really going to trust what an LLM is producing?
