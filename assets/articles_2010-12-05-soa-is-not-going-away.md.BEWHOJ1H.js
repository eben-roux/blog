I guess this is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tacit knowledge</a> comes into the picture. It may very well be that service orientation falls into this category.</p><hr><p>Let&#39;s say that I wanted to pay a bill in the 1950s by sending my creditor a cheque by mail. I also expect a letter in reply stating that my cheque has been received. I firstly place my cheque, along with some relevant information, in an envelope and write the address of the creditor to send the mail to on the front. I could also write the return address on the back. I would need to add a stamp to the envelope to demonstrate payment of the requested service. Next I would place the letter envelope in a post box. If everything is in order I can reasonably expect the recipient to receive the letter. I can assume that the post office will provide the expected <strong>service</strong>. Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean that the service will be provided as expected. There are a number of things that could go wrong but we&#39;ll hope for the best.</p><p>Service orientation has been around for a while.</p><p>I, as the user of the mail system, see a very <strong>coarse-grained</strong> service, Within the post office there are many different services of varying granularity (some quite <strong>fine-grained</strong>) provided by different departments.</p><p>Although we expect a response from the creditor, I am pretty sure that very few people will immediately run off to their own post box after popping the letter into the post box and expect the reply to pop in; nor will they wait at their own post box for the response. It is assumed that the correspondence will take a couple of days.</p><p>Let&#39;s jump back to the present and send an e-mail to a creditor. Once again, we expect a reply but we will not be watching our e-mail client application all day to see when it comes in. Again we expect some time to pass but hopefully not a couple of days. So our service will be completed <strong>eventually</strong>.</p><p>On the other hand some services are expected to be completed <strong>immediately</strong>. It depends on how consistent our information needs to be at any one time. For instance, I have a bank account with no overdraft facility. I draw my last ZAR100 from an ATM. Since my wife may draw money using the same account from another ATM I guess that bank would prefer that she not draw &quot;the last ZAR100&quot; also. The first transaction would block the second until it has been updated after which the second would fail since there would be insufficient funds. There <em>may</em> be no place for eventual consistency here. I say &#39;may&#39; because the bank could decide to allow such behaviour and simply impose penalties.</p>',8),r=[i];function s(l,c,h,p,d,m){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const y=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
