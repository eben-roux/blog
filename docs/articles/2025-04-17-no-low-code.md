I recently watched a video where the presenter made use of [n8n](https://n8n.io/) which provides "Flexible AI workflow automation".  At one stage he mentioned how much work it would be to perform these tasks using code.

That got me thinking.  Why would it be so much harder with code?  Behind the scenes, each of those task blocks is executing code.  It seems as though there much be some treasure trove of implemented logic that could be expressed as re-usable components, which could be just as easily invoked.

## Workflow

I guess the main selling point is the UI-based workflow building bit.  That would be something one could do using code as well, where we'd have total control.

I must admit, after seeing how some of the tasks are configured, most non-technical folks are going to struggle.  If a competent developer had access to those magical components I'm sure we'd see some pretty extraodinary outcomes.

## Version Control

Any versioning has to be handled by the SAAS product.

## Deployment

There is no deployment.  The workflow has to be activated in some way.  I'm guessing that any triggers that rely on event internal to one's organization would need some special configuration as well as there would need to be integration between the workflow system and one's own code.

I may be missing something.  However, many frameworks make the easy things easier and the hard things impossible.
